### Project Title
Bikeshare Information

### Description
This project will read bike share information from a csv file.  After the file is read it will report on various aspects of the data (i.e. most popular starting/ending station, longest rental duration, demographic/customer info, etc.).

### Files used
* bikeshare.py - reads the specified csv file and reports various statistics on bike share usage.
* chicago.csv - bike share info for Chicago
* new_york_city.csv - bike share info for New York City
* washington.csv - bike share info for Washington

### Credits
I used a combination of google search, stackoverflow and Python documentation when I ran into coding problems or I needed to research how a specific function worked in order to generate the requested output for the project.
